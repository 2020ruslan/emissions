# Emissions project

This is an example project to demonstrate project management for a course on reproducible coding.

## Data source
The data was downloaded from the Dutch Bureau of Statistics at [statline.cbs.nl][http://statline.cbs.nl/Statweb/selection/?VW=T&DM=SLEN&PA=7063ENG&D1=a&D2=a&D3=a&LA=EN&HDR=T&STB=G1,G2]. We selected greenhouse gases only (CO2, N2O, and CH4), but checked all source and year boxes.
