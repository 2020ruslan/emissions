# Emissions project

This is an example project to demonstrate project management for a course on reproducible coding.

## Data source
The data was downloaded from the Dutch Bureau of Statistics at [statline.cbs.nl](http://statline.cbs.nl/Statweb/selection/?VW=T&DM=SLEN&PA=7063ENG&D1=a&D2=a&D3=a&LA=EN&HDR=T&STB=G1,G2). In 'topics', we selected greenhouse gases only (CO2, N2O, and CH4), but selected all sources and periods (1980-2017). The data was downloaded as a csv.

**Note** that Statline has been renewed and the above link may no longer function. In this case, visit [opendata.cbs.nl](https://opendata.cbs.nl/statline/#/CBS/en/dataset/7063eng/table?ts=1537862508225) and perform the described selection. We recommend comparing the header and footer of the resulting document with the input csv file in the data folder.


## Getting started
- Clone the **data** and **scripts** folders into a project folder.
- Run clean.R to set up the project structure.
